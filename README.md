# Maze-Runner--Python-Project
A n√ón maze is a collection of paths among interconnected cells in a grid, where n is the number of rows and/or the number of columns. The classic maze path-finding problem tries to find a feasible path from a source cell to a destination cell. A white cell allows a path to pass through it whereas a black cell acts as a dead-end and blocks a path.
